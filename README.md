    <p> I love my pets. We have 2 dogs. One is a Blue Heeler and one is a Boxer.</p>

    <h3 class="dinki">Dinki</h3>
<p>Dinki is the Blue Heeler. He is a very shy dog. We got him when he was about 6 months old. He is now about 2 and a half years old. He is a very smart dog. He is very self aware of everything as if he is being watched all the time. </p>
    <h3 class="boxer">Bigdog</h3>
    <p>  Bigdog is the Boxer. He is a lover. Always wants affection and wishes to be a lapdog, but he weighs 90-ish pounds. So we disagree. Bigdog is getting pretty old now. The average life span for a Boxer is 8-9 years. He will be turning 10 This July. You can tell he is old. He has a hard time getting up, his face is nearly white. It used to be black and brown. So it will be sad when he goes.</p>

    <h4>My understanding of CNC</h4>
    <p> CNC means "Computer Numerical control" CNC is used for a variety of things. It's main focus is to make an object like a toy from whatever it is they give it. So if the people give the machine a block of aluminum and told it to make a water bottle, (and it's not just telling it. It takes programming and many other factors to work it properly) with the right instuctions, it could do that. </p>
