    <h4>My understanding of CNC</h4>
    <p> CNC means "Computer Numerical control" CNC is used for a variety of things. It's main focus is to make an object like a toy from whatever it is they give it. So if the people give the machine a block of aluminum and told it to make a water bottle, (and it's not just telling it. It takes programming and many other factors to work it properly) with the right instuctions, it could do that. </p>
